👉 **Live Web App:** https://farm-fortungrow.lovable.app/
🎥 **Watch Demo (YouTube Shorts):** https://youtube.com/shorts/nKUKNANvhIA?feature=share

ArthVratta is a **farming simulation game that teaches financial literacy through gameplay**, not lectures.  
Players manage a virtual farm while learning savings, insurance, debt, diversification, and risk management — by experiencing consequences over time.

## 🎮 Why ArthVratta?

Most financial literacy apps fail because they:
- Teach theory instead of habits
- Use text-heavy content
- Ignore real-life uncertainty

**ArthVratta flips the model.**  
You don’t study finance — **you live it**.

Every decision affects future seasons.
